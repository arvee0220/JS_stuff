// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.

var firstNumber = prompt("enter first number here");
var secondNumber = prompt("enter second number here");


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var sum = alert(Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber));
var diff = alert(Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber));
var product = alert(Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber));
var quotient = alert(Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber));
